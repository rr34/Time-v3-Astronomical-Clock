# Astronomical Clock by Time v3 Technology
The Time v3 Technology astronomical clock is designed to be the most user-friendly astronomical clock in history. By using photographs digitally marked with astronomical data, the clock places the sun, moon, and stars on familiar photos in real time.

The Time v3 Astronomical Clock is a practical application of the [AstroWideImageMapper project](https://github.com/rr34/AstroWideImageMapper).

## Images from the Clock
If the clock is the most user-friendly in history, images should suffice to demonstrate what it is displaying. Keep in mind these images can be any digital photograph of any place familiar to the user.
